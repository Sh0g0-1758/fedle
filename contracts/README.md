# Fedle Contracts


We at Fedle beleive in the revolutionary power of decentralisation and the need to promote open source. 

So we drafted contracts so that users who improve our datasets and fix bugs in our open source library can get tokens. This will incentivize them to contribute more. The logic of our contracts is that once the user click GetBounty on the frontend, they will have to authorize their github account and then we will use the hash of the last commit as a check. The owner of the contract will check the PossibleContributors on a weekly basis and then give tokens to the ones whose hash matches. 

We deployed our contracts on Polygon and sepolia.
